Dynamic E-Commerce Product Catalog

Live Demo: https://e-commerce-product-catalog-2xk2.onrender.com/

Overview

This project is a dynamic e-commerce product catalog built to simulate a real-world scenario where developers must balance functional requirements with user experience considerations. Users can browse, filter, and sort products seamlessly.

The main focus of this project is to demonstrate:

Scalable and maintainable frontend architecture

Efficient API integration for dynamic data fetching

Optimized performance with pagination and infinite scrolling

Accessibility and responsiveness across devices

Project Goals

The primary objectives of the e-commerce product catalog are:

API Integration: Learn to fetch and display data from APIs dynamically.

User Convenience: Implement filtering and sorting to improve product discovery.

Enhanced Experience: Develop a responsive, user-friendly interface with seamless navigation and optimized performance.

Technologies Used

React/React Native: For building the component-based user interface.

Redux: To manage application state efficiently.

TypeScript: To ensure type safety and maintainable code.

Tailwind CSS: For designing a modern, responsive UI.

Key Features
1. API Data Integration

Fetch and display product data dynamically from a backend API.

Ensure smooth loading of products with error handling and loading states.

2. Filtering and Sorting

Category Filtering: Allow users to view products based on selected categories.

Price Sorting: Enable sorting by ascending or descending prices.

Multi-Criteria Filters: Combine filters for refined results.

3. Pagination and Infinite Scrolling

Pagination: Provide numbered navigation for viewing products in chunks.

Infinite Scrolling: Load products dynamically as users scroll, enhancing usability.

4. Responsive Design

Ensure the catalog is fully responsive across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
