#Dynamic E-Commerce Product Catalog

Live Demo: https://e-commerce-product-catalog-2xk2.onrender.com/

##Overview

This project is a dynamic e-commerce product catalog built to simulate a real-world scenario where developers balance functional requirements with user experience considerations. Users can browse, filter, and sort products seamlessly while enjoying a responsive and optimized interface.

The main focus of this project is to demonstrate:

Scalable and maintainable frontend architecture

Efficient API integration for dynamic data fetching

Optimized performance with pagination and infinite scrolling

Accessibility and responsiveness across devices

##Project Goals

API Integration: Fetch and display product data dynamically from a backend API.

User Convenience: Implement filtering and sorting for easier product discovery.

Enhanced User Experience: Build a responsive, user-friendly interface with seamless navigation and optimized performance.

##Technologies Used

React / React Native – Component-based UI development.

Redux – State management for scalable applications.

TypeScript – Type safety and maintainable code.

Tailwind CSS – Modern, responsive styling.

##Key Features
##1. API Data Integration

Dynamically fetch product data from a backend API.

Handle loading states and errors for smooth UX.

##2. Filtering and Sorting

Category Filtering: Users can filter products by category.

Price Sorting: Products can be sorted in ascending or descending order.

Multi-Criteria Filtering: Combine filters for precise results.

##3. Pagination and Infinite Scrolling

Pagination: Numbered pages for viewing products in chunks.
